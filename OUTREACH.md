Title:
Van‑Aware Live Map + UK Campsite Directory — Open Source, Runs Locally

Body:
Hi all — I built a local, van‑aware live map and campsite directory for the UK. It runs on a Raspberry Pi or phone hotspot so your data stays private. Features:
- Searchable campsite directory with images
- Live van markers (WebSocket) — simulator included
- Shortlist, visited flags (syncs across devices via WS)
- PWA install + basic offline caching
Repo + quickstart: https://github.com/<youruser>/van-aware-live-map
Try it in 2 minutes: clone, run `python3 -m http.server 8000`, open http://<YOUR_IP>:8000 on your phone. Feedback & contributors welcome!

Instagram / TikTok caption idea
"Made a local-first live map for van life — tracks your van (local only), shortlist campsites & mark visited. Link in bio to try. #vanlife #campervan #vanlifeuk"

Suggested assets to include with posts
- Short GIF (10–20s) showing phone map, shortlist, and visited toggle.
- One-sentence instructions in the post: "1) Clone repo 2) python3 -m http.server 8000 3) open http://<IP>:8000 on phone"
- Screenshot of the dashboard on mobile.

Community engagement tips
- Be explicit about privacy: local-first, optional public sharing only via tunnels.
- Offer setup help (short Zoom or phone support) to lower friction.
- Ask for data contributions: photos, coordinates, corrections — provide a simple PR template.
- Tag local meetup groups and influencers and ask for feedback.

Example call-to-action
"Try it and tell me: what filters would help most on the road? Parking type, overnight allowed, surface (tarmac/gravel), dog-friendly, or waste disposal?"

If you'd like I will:
- (A) create GitHub repos & push the files for you,
- (B) produce a ZIP for direct upload,
- (C) create the demo GIF + three social captions sized for each platform,
- (D) generate a short README.md PR template and CONTRIBUTING.md for community data submissions.

Tell me which of A/B/C/D you want me to do now and I will produce the files/samples.
